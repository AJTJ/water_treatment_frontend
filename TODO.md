Project Framework
- Should this be a vercel project? Would that help?
- It would offer SSR... but I don't think that is terribly useful at this point.
- 

State management
- Find a good, relatively low boiler plate state management library

Styling
- Styled components? Something else?

App
- Pages
- Components
- Shared
- Something like that?
